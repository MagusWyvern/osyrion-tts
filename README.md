# osyrion-tts
Hand-made script that transforms test into narrated speech

To view the `.ipynb` files, you'll need a Jupyter Notebook server  (though previewing on Github itself works too.) 

Running in a virtual environment is highly recommended.

```
python3 -m venv osyrion
source osyrion/bin/activate
```

Install the dependencies required for this project

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
